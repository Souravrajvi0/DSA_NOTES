A common misconception is that a Heap is the same as a Priority Queue, which is not true. A priority queue is an abstract data type, while a Heap is a data structure. Therefore, a Heap is not a Priority Queue, but a way to implement a Priority Queue.

**Priority Queue as an Abstract Data Type (ADT):**

- A **priority queue** is an abstract data type that operates similar to a regular queue but with an added feature: each element has a "priority" associated with it.
- In a priority queue, elements are served not just on a "first-come, first-served" basis, but according to their priority. The highest (or lowest, depending on the implementation) priority element is served before others.
- The ADT defines operations like `insert`, `find_max`/`find_min`, and `delete_max`/`delete_min` but does not specify how these operations are implemented.

**Heap as a Data Structure:**

- A **heap** is a specific data structure that can efficiently support the operations required by a priority queue.
- A heap is typically a complete binary tree (often implemented as an array) that satisfies the heap property:
    
    - In a **max-heap**, for any given node `i`, the value of `i` is greater than or equal to the values of its children.
    - In a **min-heap**, for any given node `i`, the value of `i` is less than or equal to the values of its children.
    
    **Relationship between Priority Queue and Heap:**
    
    - A **heap** is one way to implement a **priority queue**. When using a heap, operations like `insert`, `find_max`/`find_min`, and `delete_max`/`delete_min` can be performed efficiently (in logarithmic time).
    - However, a priority queue can be implemented using other data structures too, like:
        - **Binary Search Trees (BST)**
        - **Balanced Trees** (like AVL Trees or Red-Black Trees)
        - **Unsorted or Sorted Arrays/Linked Lists**
    - The **heap** is not the only data structure for implementing a priority queue; it's just a very efficient one.

### Why Heap is Not a Priority Queue

- A **heap** is like saying, "I will always keep my to-do list arranged in a way that lets me quickly find the most urgent task." It’s a **data structure** that efficiently supports this kind of arrangement.
- But a **priority queue** is just a **concept** saying, "I want to always get the most urgent task." There could be other ways to do this—just like you could use a **sorted array** or a **balanced tree** instead of a heap.

**Max-Heap vs.** `**priority_queue**`**:**

- When we say "we make a max heap in C++ using `priority_queue`," we mean that the `priority_queue` provides a max-heap interface where the maximum element is always at the top.
- The `priority_queue` is not **just** a heap; it’s an abstraction that **uses** a heap to provide priority queue operations.

  
The C++  `priority_queue` is just a convenient wrapper around a heap to provide priority queue functionality.  
  

A Heap is a special type of binary tree.  
**A heap is a binary tree that meets the following criteria:

- Is a **complete binary tree**;
- The value of each node must be **no greater than (or no less than)** the value of its child nodes.

A Heap has the following properties:

- Insertion of an element into the Heap has a time complexity of _O_(log_N_);
    
    O(log⁡N)
    
- Deletion of an element from the Heap has a time complexity of _O_(log_N_);
    
    O(log⁡N)
    
- The maximum/minimum value in the Heap can be obtained with _O_(1) time complexity.
    
    O(1)
