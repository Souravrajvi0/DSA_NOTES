## Problem Statement
> Copy the problem statement here for quick reference.
> Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, every element appears _twice_ except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,2,1]
**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
**Output:** 4

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1]
**Output:** 1

int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){
            ans=ans^nums[i];
        }
        return ans;
        
    }
```
