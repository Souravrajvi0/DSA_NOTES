**CONCEPT:** [[]]


## Problem Statement
Statement-You are given a weighted undirected graph havingÂ **n**Â vertices numbered fromÂ **1 to n**Â andÂ **m**Â edges along with their weights. Find theÂ **shortest**Â **weight**Â **path**Â between the vertex 1 and the vertexÂ **n**,Â Â if there exists a path, and returnÂ a list of integers whose first element is theÂ **weight**Â of the path, and the rest consist of the nodes on that path. If no path exists, then return a list containing a single elementÂ **-1**.

The input list of edges is as follows -Â **{a, b, w}**, denoting there is an edge betweenÂ **a**Â andÂ **b**, andÂ **w**Â is the weight of that edge.

**_Note:_**Â The driver code here will first checkÂ if theÂ weight of the pathÂ returned isÂ **equal**Â to theÂ **sum**Â of the weights along the nodes on that path, ifÂ **equal**Â it will output theÂ weight of the path,Â elseÂ **-2**. In case the list contains only a single element (**-1**)Â it will simply outputÂ **-1**.Â 

**Examples :**

**Input:** n = 5, m= 6, edges = [[1, 2, 2], [2, 5, 5], [2, 3, 4], [1, 4, 1], [4, 3, 3], [3, 5, 1]]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Shortest path from 1 to n is by the path 1 4 3 5 whose weight is 5. 

**Input:** n = 2, m= 1, edges = [[1, 2, 2]]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Shortest path from 1 to 2 is by the path 1 2 whose weight is 2. 

**Input:** n = 2, m= 0, edges = [ ]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** Since there are no edges, so no answer is possible.

**Expected Time Complexity:**Â O(m* log(n))  
**Expected Space Complexity:**Â O(n+m)

**Constraint:**  
2 <= n <= 106  
0 <= m <= 106  
1 <= a, b <= n  
1 <= w <= 105

## Approach / Thought Process
## ðŸ§  Thought Process

1. **What was asked?**
   - [ ] Identify key input/output
   - [ ] What type of problem is it?  DIJASTRA LAG RAHA HAI SAAF WO DIKHTA HAI!!!

1. **What did I think at first?**
Dijkastra lag raha hai saf ye dik raha hai! But mujhe problem ai ki main path kaise yad rkahon!!!
Dijkastra ek traversing algorithm bhi hai!
Just thoda sa memoisatio karke hum shortest path nikal sktte hain!

HINT - WHERE AM I COMING FROM?? YAD RAKHNA HAI!




3. **Other approaches I considered?**



4. **Why I chose this approach?**


   
### BRUTE FORCE:

```c++
class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> shortestPath(int n, int m, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        // Code here
        vector<vector<pair<int,int>>> adj(n+1);
        for (auto& it : edges) {
            int u = it[0], v = it[1], w = it[2];
            adj[u].push_back({v, w});
             adj[v].push_back({u, w});
        }
        priority_queue<pair<int,int>,vector<pair<int,int>>,greater<pair<int,int>>>pq;
        vector<int>distance(n+1,INT_MAX);
        distance[1]=0;
        vector<int>parent(n+1);

                    if(distance[node]+it.second<distance[it.first]){
                       distance[it.first] = distance[node]+it.second;
                       pq.push({distance[it.first],it.first});
                       parent[it.first] = node;
                    }
                }
            
            
        }
        
        vector<int>res;
        if(distance[n]==INT_MAX){
            res.push_back(-1);
            return res;
        }

        int i = n;
        while(i!=1){
            res.push_back(i);
            i = parent[i];
        }
        res.push_back(1);
        reverse(res.begin(),res.end());
        res.insert(res.begin(), distance[n]);
