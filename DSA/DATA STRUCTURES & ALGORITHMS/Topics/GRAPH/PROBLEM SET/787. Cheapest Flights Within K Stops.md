## Problem Statement
Statement-There areÂ `n`Â cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an arrayÂ `flights`Â whereÂ `flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei]`Â indicates that there is a flight from cityÂ `fromi`Â to cityÂ `toi`Â with costÂ `pricei`.

You are also given three integersÂ `src`,Â `dst`, andÂ `k`, returnÂ _**the cheapest price**Â from_Â `src`Â _to_Â `dst`Â _with at most_Â `k`Â _stops._Â If there is no such route, returnÂ `-1`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/18/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops-3drawio.png)

**Input:** n = 4, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[2,0,100],[1,3,600],[2,3,200]], src = 0, dst = 3, k = 1
**Output:** 700
**Explanation:**
The graph is shown above.
The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 3 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 600 = 700.
Note that the path through cities [0,1,2,3] is cheaper but is invalid because it uses 2 stops.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/18/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops-1drawio.png)

**Input:** n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
**Output:** 200
**Explanation:**
The graph is shown above.
The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 100 = 200.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/18/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops-2drawio.png)

**Input:** n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
**Output:** 500
**Explanation:**
The graph is shown above.
The optimal path with no stops from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 500.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `0 <= flights.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)`
- `flights[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= fromi, toi < n`
- `fromi != toi`
- `1 <= pricei <= 104`
- There will not be any multiple flights between two cities.
- `0 <= src, dst, k < n`
- `src != dst`
