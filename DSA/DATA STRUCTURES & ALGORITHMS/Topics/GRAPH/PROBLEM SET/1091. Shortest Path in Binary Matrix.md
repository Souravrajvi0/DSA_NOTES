## Problem Statement
Statement-Given anÂ `n x n`Â binary matrixÂ `grid`, returnÂ _the length of the shortestÂ **clear path**Â in the matrix_. If there is no clear path, returnÂ `-1`.

AÂ **clear path**Â in a binary matrix is a path from theÂ **top-left**Â cell (i.e.,Â `(0, 0)`) to theÂ **bottom-right**Â cell (i.e.,Â `(n - 1, n - 1)`) such that:

- All the visited cells of the path areÂ `0`.
- All the adjacent cells of the path areÂ **8-directionally**Â connected (i.e., they are different and they share an edge or a corner).

TheÂ **length of a clear path**Â is the number of visited cells of this path.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/18/example1_1.png)

**Input:** grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/18/example2_1.png)

**Input:** grid = [[0,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]
**Output:** 4

**Example 3:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]
**Output:** -1

**Constraints:**

- `n == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `grid[i][j] is 0 or 1`

## Approach / Thought Process
## ðŸ§  Thought Process

1. **What was asked?**
   - [ ] Identify key input/output
   - [ ] What type of problem is it?

1. **What did I think at first?**
Well undirected graph with unit edges made me feel like using bfs since dijkastra can only be used with edges with weight!!!



3. **Other approaches I considered?**



4. **Why I chose this approach?**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int shortestPathBinaryMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        vector<vector<int>>dis(n,vector<int>(n,INT_MAX));
        if(grid[0][0]==1||grid[n-1][n-1]==1)return -1;
        dis[0][0] = 1;

        queue<pair<int,int>>q;
        q.push({0,0});


        while(!q.empty()){
            pair<int,int>temp = q.front();
            q.pop();
            int i = temp.first;
            int j = temp.second;


            for(int l = -1;l <= 1; l++){
                for(int m = -1; m <= 1; m++){

                    int ni = i+l;
                    int nj = j+m;

                   if(ni>=0&&nj>=0&&ni<n&&nj<n&&grid[ni][nj]==0){
                      if(dis[i][j]+1<dis[ni][nj]){
                            dis[ni][nj]=dis[i][j]+1;
