## Problem Statement
Statement-You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are givenÂ `heights`, a 2D array of sizeÂ `rows x columns`, whereÂ `heights[row][col]`Â represents the height of cellÂ `(row, col)`. You are situated in the top-left cell,Â `(0, 0)`, and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell,Â `(rows-1, columns-1)`Â (i.e.,Â **0-indexed**). You can moveÂ **up**,Â **down**,Â **left**, orÂ **right**, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimumÂ **effort**.

A route'sÂ **effort**Â is theÂ **maximum absolute difference**Â in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.

ReturnÂ _the minimumÂ **effort**Â required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell._

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/04/ex1.png)

**Input:** heights = [[1,2,2],[3,8,2],[5,3,5]]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The route of [1,3,5,3,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 2 in consecutive cells.
This is better than the route of [1,2,2,2,5], where the maximum absolute difference is 3.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/04/ex2.png)

**Input:** heights = [[1,2,3],[3,8,4],[5,3,5]]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The route of [1,2,3,4,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 1 in consecutive cells, which is better than route [1,3,5,3,5].

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/04/ex3.png)

**Input:** heights = [[1,2,1,1,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,1,1,2,1]]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** This route does not require any effort.

**Constraints:**

- `rows == heights.length`
- `columns == heights[i].length`
- `1 <= rows, columns <= 100`
- `1 <= heights[i][j] <= 106`

### BRUTE FORCE:
TC:
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumEffortPath(vector<vector<int>>& heights) {
        int n = heights.size();
        int m = heights[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>>eff(n,vector<int>(m,INT_MAX));
        eff[0][0]=0;
        priority_queue<vector<int>,vector<vector<int>>,greater<vector<int>>>pq;
        vector<int>ans;
        ans.push_back(0);
        ans.push_back(0);
        ans.push_back(0);
        pq.push(ans);

        int dx[] = {-1,0,1,0};
        int dy[] = {0,1,0,-1};

        while(!pq.empty()){;
            vector<int>temp = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            
            int i = temp[1];
            int j = temp[2];

            for(int l=0;l<4;l++){
                int ni = i+dx[l];
                int nj = j+dy[l];
                if(ni>=0&&nj>=0&&ni<n&&nj<m){
                  int effort = max(eff[i][j],abs(heights[i][j]-heights[ni][nj]));// ye line
                  if(eff[ni][nj]>effort){
                    eff[ni][nj]=effort;
                    pq.push({effort,ni,nj});
                  }
                  
                }
            }
        }
        return eff[n-1][m-1];
    }
