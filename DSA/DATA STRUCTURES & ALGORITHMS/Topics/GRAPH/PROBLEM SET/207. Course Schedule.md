**CONCEPT:** [[]]


## Problem Statement
Statement-There are a total ofÂ `numCourses`Â courses you have to take, labeled fromÂ `0`Â toÂ `numCourses - 1`. You are given an arrayÂ `prerequisites`Â whereÂ `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]`Â indicates that youÂ **must**Â take courseÂ `bi`Â first if you want to take courseÂ `ai`.

- For example, the pairÂ `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take courseÂ `0`Â you have to first take courseÂ `1`.

ReturnÂ `true`Â if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, returnÂ `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
- All the pairs prerequisites[i] areÂ **unique**.

## Approach / Thought Process
## ğŸ§  Thought Process

1. **What was asked?**
   - [ ] Identify key input/output
   - [ ] What type of problem is it?

2. **What did I think at first?**
AGAR KOI CYCLE NAHI HAI TOH MTLB TOPO SORT HO SAKTA HAI KOI!!


3. **Other approaches I considered?**



4. **Why I chose this approach?**


   
### BRUTE FORCE:
TC:
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool dfs(vector<int>&vis,vector<int>&pathvis,vector<vector<int>>&adj,int start){
        vis[start]=1;
        pathvis[start]=1;

        for(auto it : adj[start]){
            if(!vis[it]){
                if(dfs(vis,pathvis,adj,it)){
                    return true;
                }
            }else if (pathvis[it]){
                return true;
            }
        }
        pathvis[start]=0;
        return false;
    }



    bool canFinish(int V, vector<vector<int>>& p) {
         vector<vector<int>>adj(V+1);
        for(auto it : p){
            adj[it[1]].push_back(it[0]);
        }
        vector<int>vis(V+1,0);
        vector<int>pathvis(V+1,0);

        for(int i =1;i<=V;i++){
            if(!vis[i]){
                if(dfs(vis,pathvis,adj,i)){
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
