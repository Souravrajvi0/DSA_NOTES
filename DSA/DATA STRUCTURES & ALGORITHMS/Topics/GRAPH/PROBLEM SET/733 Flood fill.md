## Problem Statement
Statement-You are given an image represented by anÂ `m x n`Â grid of integersÂ `image`, whereÂ `image[i][j]`Â represents the pixel value of the image. You are also given three integersÂ `sr`,Â `sc`, andÂ `color`. Your task is to perform aÂ **flood fill**Â on the image starting from the pixelÂ `image[sr][sc]`.

To perform aÂ **flood fill**:

1. Begin with the starting pixel and change its color toÂ `color`.
2. Perform the same process for each pixel that isÂ **directly adjacent**Â (pixels that share a side with the original pixel, either horizontally or vertically) and shares theÂ **same color**Â as the starting pixel.
3. KeepÂ **repeating**Â this process by checking neighboring pixels of theÂ _updated_Â pixelsÂ and modifying their color if it matches the original color of the starting pixel.
4. The processÂ **stops**Â when there areÂ **no more**Â adjacent pixels of the original color to update.

Return theÂ **modified**Â image after performing the flood fill.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**Â image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2

**Output:**Â [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]

**Explanation:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/01/flood1-grid.jpg)

From the center of the image with positionÂ `(sr, sc) = (1, 1)`Â (i.e., the red pixel), all pixels connected by a path of the same color as the starting pixel (i.e., the blue pixels) are colored with the new color.

Note the bottom corner isÂ **not**Â colored 2, because it is not horizontally or vertically connected to the starting pixel.

**Example 2:**

**Input:**Â image = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], sr = 0, sc = 0, color = 0

**Output:**Â [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]

**Explanation:**

The starting pixel is already colored with 0, which is the same as the target color. Therefore, no changes are made to the image.

**Constraints:**

- `m == image.length`
- `n == image[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `0 <= image[i][j], color < 216`
- `0 <= sr < m`
- `0 <= sc < n`

## Approach / Thought Process
## ðŸ§  Thought Process

1. **What was asked?**
   - [ ] Identify key input/output
   - [ ] What type of problem is it?

2. **What did I think at first?**
same feel thi as of bfs and dfs jada kuch fight thi nahi


3. **Other approaches I considered?**



4. **Why I chose this approach?**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
   void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& image, int sr, int sc, int color,int initialcolor){
    if(image[sr][sc]==color)return;
    image[sr][sc]=color;
    int n = image.size();
    int m = image[0].size();

    int dx [] = {-1,0,1,0};
    int dy [] = {0,1,0,-1};

    for(int i=0;i<4;i++){
        int x = sr+dx[i];
        int y = sc+dy[i];
        if(x>=0&&y>=0&&x<n&&y<m&&image[x][y]==initialcolor){
            dfs(image,x,y,color,initialcolor);
        }
    }
   }
   
    vector<vector<int>> floodFill(vector<vector<int>>& image, int sr, int sc, int color) {
        int n = image.size();
        int m = image[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>>vis(n,vector<int>(m,0));
