## Problem Statement
Statement-There are a total ofÂ `numCourses`Â courses you have to take, labeled fromÂ `0`Â toÂ `numCourses - 1`. You are given an arrayÂ `prerequisites`Â whereÂ `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]`Â indicates that youÂ **must**Â take courseÂ `bi`Â first if you want to take courseÂ `ai`.

- For example, the pairÂ `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take courseÂ `0`Â you have to first take courseÂ `1`.

ReturnÂ _the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses_. If there are many valid answers, returnÂ **any**Â of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, returnÂ **an empty array**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
**Output:** [0,1]
**Explanation:** There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
**Output:** [0,2,1,3]
**Explanation:** There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
**Output:** [0]

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 1)`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
- `ai != bi`
- All the pairsÂ `[ai, bi]`Â areÂ **distinct**.
