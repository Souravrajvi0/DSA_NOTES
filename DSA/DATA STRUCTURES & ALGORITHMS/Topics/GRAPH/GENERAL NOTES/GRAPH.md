## üß† Basic Concepts First

### 1. **What is a cycle?**

A **cycle** in an undirected graph means:

> You can start at a node, go through some edges, and come back to the same node **without repeating any edge or node (except the start node).**

### **Why BFS?**

- BFS (Breadth-First Search) explores nodes **level by level**.
    
- In an **undirected graph**, a cycle exists **if you encounter a node that has already been visited and is NOT the parent of the current node.**
### üéØ Key idea:

> While doing BFS, if we visit an already visited node that is **not the parent** ‚Üí **Cycle exists**.



## ‚úÖ Algorithm

Let's break it down step-by-step.

### üß© Step 1: Prepare the Graph

We‚Äôll use an **adjacency list** to represent the graph.
### üß© Step 2: Use a `visited` array to track which nodes we've seen.

### üß© Step 3: For every unvisited node, run BFS and check for cycle.

## The Intuition (in plain words)

### In an undirected graph:

Every edge is **bidirectional**, so when you go from `A ‚Üí B`, you also have an edge `B ‚Üí A`.

### So while traversing with BFS:

- If you reach a **node that you've already visited**, that could be a cycle.
    
- But wait! It might just be the node you **came from** (i.e., the **parent**).
    
- So the **real check** is:
    

> If a neighbor is already visited **and it is NOT the parent**, then you‚Äôve found a **cycle**.

## During BFS

- Use a **queue** to do normal BFS.
    
- Instead of storing only the node in the queue, store a **pair: `(current_node, parent_node)`**
    
- Why? Because when we encounter a visited node, we need to check if it‚Äôs the parent ‚Äî if it‚Äôs not, it means there's a back-edge (i.e., a cycle).

## Core Logic (Step-by-Step)

1. **Start BFS from any unvisited node.**
    
2. Use a queue to do the BFS traversal.
    
    - Each element in the queue is a **pair**: `{node, parent}`
        
3. For each neighbor of the current node:
    
    - If it's **not visited**, mark as visited and push `{neighbor, current}` to the queue.
        
    - If it's **already visited**:
        
        - And it's **not the parent**, then you've found a **cycle**.

## üîÅ Algorithm Setup

We‚Äôll perform a BFS from an unvisited node, say `0`.  
We maintain:

- A **`visited[]` array**
    
- A **`queue<pair<node, parent>>`**
    

---

### üîπ Initial State:

- `visited = [false, false, false, false, false, false]`
    
- `queue = empty`

## ‚úÖ Final Result

As soon as we detect that:

- A neighbor is already visited
    
- And that neighbor is **not the parent**
    

üëâ **We return true: Cycle exists.**

---

## üß† What just happened?

We were at `2`, and saw neighbor `4`:

- 4 was already visited from node `5`
    
- But we‚Äôre now seeing it again from node `2` (not parent)  
    ‚û°Ô∏è That means **two different paths** are trying to reach the same node ‚Üí this creates a **loop**.


> In an **undirected graph**, if during traversal (BFS or DFS) you encounter a node that you've already visited **and** it's **not the parent**, then you're visiting that node through a **different path** ‚Üí and **that forms a cycle**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why do we need to check: ‚Äúif neighbor is parent ‚Üí ignore‚Äù?

Because in an **undirected graph**, every edge goes both ways.

## ‚úÖ **Cycle Detection in Undirected Graph Using DFS**


## üí° **1. Core Intuition**

In an **undirected graph**, a **cycle** exists if you revisit an already visited node **that is not the parent**.

This happens because:

- Every undirected edge is bidirectional.
    
- If you're at node `A` and go to `B`, you'll see `A` as a neighbor again from `B`.
    
- That‚Äôs **fine** because `A` is the **parent**.
    
- But if from `B` you go to a neighbor `C` that‚Äôs **already visited and not the parent**, then a **cycle exists**



## üß† **2. Core Logic**

We do a **DFS traversal**:

- Mark each node as visited
    
- For each neighbor:
    
    - If not visited ‚Üí recursively DFS on it
        
    - If already visited **and it's not the parent**, it's a cycle
        

This is done for **all disconnected components**.

## üöÄ **5. Dry Run of DFS**

We start DFS from node `0`.

### Stack Trace:

- `dfs(0, -1)` ‚Üí mark `0` as visited
    
    - neighbor `1` is unvisited ‚Üí `dfs(1, 0)`
        
        - mark `1` visited
            
        - neighbor `2` is unvisited ‚Üí `dfs(2, 1)`
            
            - mark `2` visited
                
            - neighbor `3` is unvisited ‚Üí `dfs(3, 2)`
                
                - mark `3` visited
                    
                - neighbor `4` is unvisited ‚Üí `dfs(4, 3)`
                    
                    - mark `4` visited
                        
                    - neighbor `0` is **already visited** and **not parent**  
                        ‚Üí **Cycle detected! ‚úÖ**

# ‚úÖ **Cycle Detection in Directed Graph using BFS (Kahn's Algorithm)**

## üí° 1. **Intuition**

In a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)**, every node will eventually have in-degree 0 during **topological sort**.

> But if there is a **cycle**, then **some node's in-degree will never become 0** ‚Äî meaning, you **cannot complete the topological order**.

So, if we try to perform **Kahn‚Äôs Algorithm** for topological sorting:

- If we can process **all `V` nodes** ‚Üí ‚úÖ No cycle
    
- If we get **stuck before visiting all nodes** ‚Üí ‚ùå Cycle exists


## üîÅ 2. **Core Logic**

- Build an adjacency list from edge list
    
- Track **in-degree** (incoming edges) of every node
    
- Initialize a queue with nodes having `in-degree = 0`
    
- While the queue is not empty:
    
    - Pop a node
        
    - For each of its neighbors:
        
        - Reduce their in-degree by 1
            
        - If their in-degree becomes 0 ‚Üí push into queue
            
- Keep count of how many nodes you've processed
    
- **If processed nodes < V ‚Üí cycle exists**


## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. **Algorithm Setup**

### üì• Input

- `V`: Number of nodes
    
- `edges`: Directed edges `u ‚Üí v`
    

### üõ†Ô∏è Build Structures
```c++
vector<vector<int>> adj(V);
vector<int> indegree(V, 0);

for (auto [u, v] : edges) {
    adj[u].push_back(v);
    indegree[v]++;
}

```


![GRAPH 1.2-20250717142324835.webp](../../../../../Images/GRAPH%201.2-20250717142324835.webp)

## üß™ 5. **Dry Run on Example**

### Step 1: Queue initialization

Nodes with in-degree 0 ‚Üí only `0`  
Queue = `[0]`

### Step 2: BFS loop

#### ‚è≥ Iteration 1:

- Pop `0`, process `1`
    
    - in[1] = 2 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí still not 0
        
- Queue = `[]`
    
- Processed count = 1
    

Queue is now **empty**, but we have **not visited all nodes (only 1/4)**

# ‚úÖ Cycle Detection in Directed Graph using **DFS**
## üí° 1. **Intuition**

In a **directed graph**, a cycle exists if we **reach a node that is already on the current DFS path** (i.e., we revisit a node _before_ completing its entire recursion).

To detect that, we use:

- `vis[]`: to mark if a node has ever been visited
    
- `pathVis[]`: to mark if a node is currently part of the ongoing recursive DFS path
    

> If we find `vis[node] == 1` and `pathVis[node] == 1` during DFS ‚Äî it means we're going in circles ‚Üí **Cycle Detected**

---

## üß† 2. Core Logic

- For every unvisited node:
    
    - Start DFS
        
    - Mark it visited in both `vis[]` and `pathVis[]`
        
    - For each neighbor:
        
        - If unvisited ‚Üí DFS on it
            
        - If visited and on current path ‚Üí cycle
            
    - After visiting all children, mark `pathVis[node] = 0` (backtrack)

# üß† What is Kahn's Algorithm?

Kahn's algorithm is a **BFS-based** way to perform **topological sorting** of a **DAG** (Directed Acyclic Graph).

### ‚úÖ Key Idea:

> At every step, choose a node with **in-degree 0** (no incoming edges), process it, and remove it from the graph.

---

## üîÅ Why BFS Instead of DFS?

- DFS builds topological order using **postorder recursion**
    
- Kahn's algorithm builds it **layer-by-layer** using a queue
    
- It's more intuitive for ‚Äú**task without prerequisites first**‚Äù kind of problems
    

---

## üìå Definitions

- **In-degree** of a node = number of edges coming _into_ it
    
- A node with `in-degree 0` has **no prerequisites**
    

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Algorithm

1. **Build the adjacency list** from the edges
    
2. **Compute in-degrees** of all nodes
    
3. **Push all nodes with in-degree 0** into a queue
    
4. While queue is not empty:
    
    - Pop a node, add it to the result
        
    - Reduce in-degree of its neighbors by 1
        
    - If any neighbor‚Äôs in-degree becomes 0, push it to the queue
        
5. If the result size ‚â† number of nodes ‚Üí there's a **cycle**


```c++
class Solution {
  public:
    void bfs(vector<int>& res, vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<int>& indegree) {
        queue<int> q;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < indegree.size(); i++) {
            if (indegree[i] == 0) {
                q.push(i);
            }
        }

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int temp = q.front();

## üîë Core Intuition of Kahn's Algorithm

Kahn‚Äôs Algorithm is based on a simple idea:

> **‚ÄúIf a task has no prerequisites, do it now.‚Äù**

That means:

- Find nodes with **in-degree 0** (no incoming edges)
    
- Process them ‚Üí mark them as done
    
- Then reduce in-degrees of the nodes that depended on them
    
- If any of those now have `in-degree = 0`, add them to the queue
    
- Keep repeating

![GRAPH 1.3-20250716160002944.webp](../../../../../Images/GRAPH%201.3-20250716160002944.webp)

## Why It Works:

### 1. Nodes with in-degree 0 are **safe to process**:

- They have **no dependencies left**
    
- So they can go first in the topo sort
    

### 2. When you remove a node (A), all edges from it (A ‚Üí B) are also removed:

- So reduce `in-degree` of B
    
- If B becomes 0 ‚Üí it's ready next
    

### 3. This gives a **layer-by-layer BFS**:

- First all nodes with no prerequisites
    
- Then all nodes whose dependencies are completed
    
- And so on‚Ä¶


## üí• What if there‚Äôs a cycle?

- Some nodes will **never reach in-degree 0**
    
- So queue will get stuck
    
- If `res.size() < V`, then üîÅ **cycle exists**
    

This is how Kahn's also **detects cycles** naturally.


> **"Why do we decrease the in-degree of adjacent nodes when we remove a node?"**

This is the _core intuition_ of Kahn‚Äôs Algorithm, so let me explain it with a super clear analogy and a simple breakdown.

![GRAPH 1.3-20250716160203021.webp](../../../../../Images/GRAPH%201.3-20250716160203021.webp)

### Step 1: Start with nodes with in-degree `0` ‚Üí **A**

You process A.

That means:

> You‚Äôve completed A, so **B no longer needs to wait for A.**

‚û°Ô∏è So you **decrease in-degree of B by 1**

Now B‚Äôs in-degree becomes `0`.

---

### üîπ Step 2: Process B

Again, B is done.  
‚û°Ô∏è So C **no longer needs to wait for B** ‚Üí decrease C‚Äôs in-degree by 1  
C becomes `0` ‚Üí ready to process

### ‚úÖ Intuition Rule

> **When you complete a task (node), remove its dependency effect on other tasks.**

That‚Äôs exactly what decreasing the in-degree does:

- The edge `A ‚Üí B` means ‚ÄúB depends on A‚Äù
    
- Once A is done, you **eliminate that dependency**
    
- So B is **closer to being free to process**
    

---

## üî® Why Do We Need To Track In-Degree?

Because **in-degree tells us how many things a task is still waiting on.**

Only when in-degree becomes `0`, we can say:

> "This task is now free to run."

So reducing in-degree of adjacent nodes = removing a finished prerequisite from their waiting list.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Cases to Consider

|Case|How to Handle|
|---|---|
|**Single Node, No Edges**|No cycle possible. Always return `false`.|
|**Disconnected Graph**|Always loop over all nodes (`for i in 0 to V`) to ensure full component check.|
|**Self-Loop (u ‚Üí u)**|Always check `if neighbor == node` in both DFS and BFS. Return `true`.|
|**Parallel Edges (u ‚Üî v)**|Can cause false positives if you don't track parent in undirected graphs.|
|**Empty Graph (V=0)**|Return `false`. Edge list/adjacency list will be empty.|

- **Undirected Graph**
    
    - üß† Use **DFS** if:
        
        - You‚Äôre comfortable with recursion.
            
        - Code needs to be compact.
            
    - üîÅ Use **BFS** if:
        
        - You prefer iterative logic or are BFS-focused.
            
- **Directed Graph**
    
    - üß† Use **DFS** if:
        
        - You want precise cycle detection based on call-stack path.
            
        - You're already doing DFS (like for coloring, path tracking).
            
    - üßÆ Use **Kahn‚Äôs Algorithm** if:
        
        - You‚Äôre checking if a graph is a DAG.
            
        - You're also generating a topological sort.
