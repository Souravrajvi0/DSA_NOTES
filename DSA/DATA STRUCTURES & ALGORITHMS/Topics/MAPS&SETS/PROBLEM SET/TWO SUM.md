**CONCEPT:** [Using set or map as a container which can only contain unique elements](../CONCEPTS/Using%20set%20or%20map%20as%20a%20container%20which%20can%20only%20contain%20unique%20elements.md)

PROBLEM LINK:https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## Approach / Thought Process
1. **Initial Thoughts**: 
   - Write down your initial understanding and ideas for solving this problem.
   - Target Can be negative and even the numbers in the array can be negative as well!
   - only one solution is present!

2. **Approach Options**:
   - Describe any alternative approaches you considered.
   - WHY USE HASH MAP HERE?? WELL INDEX RETURN KARNE HAI TOH KEY VALUE PAIR BAN RAHE HAI NA BHAI! KEY HOGAYA NUMBER AND VALUE HOGAYI INDEX

3. **Chosen Solution**:
   - Describe the approach you settled on and why.
