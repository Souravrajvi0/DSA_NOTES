→We don’t have to just choose 2 pointer we can also take 3,4 pointers depending upon the question

THERE ARE 4 Things I need to keep in mind while using These

1. Physical Significance of the pointer- Since i,j Can be used as pair or length or anything depending upon the question
2. How To initialze the pointer
3. How to move the pointers
4. When To stop
