# PRUNING AND THEN CHANGING THE STATE!!

## What Problem Led Me to This Concept?
- First discovered in: QUEEN MEIN JADA VISIBLE THA BUT PEMUTATION MEIN BHI LAG RAHA THA
- Recognized pattern while: (what you were trying to do)

## What Does This Concept Do?
- Simple explanation in your own words
 HUM NA PEHLE RECURSIVE BRUTE FORCE HI LAGANE KI SOCHTE HAIN BASS JO ACTION HUMNE LIYE HOTE HAIN UNKO CALL SE AATE VAQT ORIGINAL STATE MEIN LAKAR CHOR DETE HAIN
- Main purpose/goal
Recursive brute force ka paradigm hi hai but state changes ko involve karta hai
- When to think of using this
Jabh kuch action se aage options ka path jo hai na wo hamper ho raha ho like beautifully explained in permutations problem!!


## How to Apply This Concept?
1. Pruning toh pehle hi kar dete hain 
2. Revert to old state

## Key Things to Remember
- Revert just recursive call se vapis jarahe hote hain tabh krte hain
- Important point 2
- Common mistakes to avoid
