STACK IS A DATA STRUCTURE THAT HOLD DATA THAT CAN BE OF ANY TYPE
- Integer , string
- double 
- pair 
- customised data type as well

## üìå What is a Stack?

A **stack** is a **linear data structure** that follows the **LIFO** principle ‚Äî **Last In, First Out**.

### üîÅ Real-life Analogy:

Think of a stack of books:

- You **add** a book on **top**.
    
- You **remove** a book from the **top**.
    

You can't take a book from the middle without removing the ones above it.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Operations

| Operation          | Description                      | Time Complexity |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `push(x)`          | Insert an element `x` on the top | O(1)            |
| `pop()`            | Remove the top/last element      | O(1)            |
| `top()` / `peek()` | Access the top/last element      | O(1)            |
| `empty()`          | Check if the stack is empty      | O(1)            |
| `size()`           | Get the number of elements       | O(1)            |
