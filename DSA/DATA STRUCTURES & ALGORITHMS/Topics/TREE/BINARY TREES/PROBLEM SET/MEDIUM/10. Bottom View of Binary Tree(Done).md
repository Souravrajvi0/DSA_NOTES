### BRUTE FORCE:
TC: JADA KUCH THA HI NAHI
```c++
vector <int> bottomView(Node *root) {
        // Your Code Here
    vector<int>ans;
    if(!root)return ans;
    
    queue<pair<Node*,int>>q;
    q.push({root,0});
    map<int,int>mp;
    
    while(!q.empty()){
        auto p = q.front();
        q.pop();
        
        Node*temp = p.first;
        int line = p.second;
        
        
        mp[line]=temp->data;
       
        
        
        if(temp->left)q.push({temp->left,line-1});
        if(temp->right)q.push({temp->right,line+1});
    }
    
    for(auto p : mp){
       ans.push_back(p.second); 
        
    }    
    return ans;
    }
