    int helper(TreeNode* root){
    if(!root)return 0;
    int leftpathsum=max(0,helper(root->left));
    int rightpathsum=max(0,helper(root->right));
    int sum=root->val+leftpathsum+rightpathsum;
    maxsum=max(sum,maxsum);
    return root->val+max(leftpathsum,rightpathsum);
   }

    int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root) {
    helper(root);
    return maxsum;
    }
