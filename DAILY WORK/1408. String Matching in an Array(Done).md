## Problem Statement
> Copy the problem statement here for quick reference.
> Given an array of string `words`, return _all strings in_ `words` _that is a **substring** of another word_. You can return the answer in **any order**.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = ["mass","as","hero","superhero"]
**Output:** ["as","hero"]
**Explanation:** "as" is substring of "mass" and "hero" is substring of "superhero".
["hero","as"] is also a valid answer.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** words = ["leetcode","et","code"]
**Output:** ["et","code"]
**Explanation:** "et", "code" are substring of "leetcode".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** words = ["blue","green","bu"]
**Output:** []
**Explanation:** No string of words is substring of another string.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`
- `words[i]` contains only lowercase English letters.
- All the strings of `words` are **unique**.

## Approach / Thought Process
1. **Initial Thoughts**: 
   - Write down your initial understanding and ideas for solving this problem.
   - STRINGS CHECK KARNE HAIN!

2. **Approach Options**:
   - Describe any alternative approaches you considered.
   - BRUTE FORCE
   ```c++
vector<string> stringMatching(vector<string>& words) {
        vector<string>ans;

        for(int i=0;i<words.size();i++){
            for(int j=0;j<words.size();j++){
                if(i==j)continue;
                int pos=words[j].find(words[i]);
                if(pos!=string :: npos){
                    ans.push_back(words[i]);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
        
    }
```

2nd Approach Ye kar sakte hain ki bhai!

Ki string ko sort karlo on the basis of size and then jus
