PROBLEM LINK:
## Problem Statement
You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `pref`.

Return _the number of strings in_ `words` _that contain_ `pref` _as a **prefix**_.

A **prefix** of a string `s` is any leading contiguous substring of `s`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = ["pay","**at**tention","practice","**at**tend"], `pref` = "at"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The 2 strings that contain "at" as a prefix are: "**at**tention" and "**at**tend".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** words = ["leetcode","win","loops","success"], `pref` = "code"
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There are no strings that contain "code" as a prefix.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
- `1 <= words[i].length, pref.length <= 100`
- `words[i]` and `pref` consist of lowercase English letters.

        for(int i = 0; i < words.size(); i++){
            if(words[i].compare(0,pref.size(),pref) == 0){
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
